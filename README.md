# My Thoughts on the Article

Skepticism about AI's ability to generate meaningful test cases has an added concern about data privacy and security. The fear about intellectual property leaks, data permanenc, and inability of models to "unlearn" sensitive data raises serious questions. This obviously creates many issues, namely increased potential for illegal activity using AI models. 

# My Comment on "Data Privacy and Security in AI-Driven Testing"


This article underscores the need for balancing AI's efficiency with security, suggesting techniques like **on-premises AI processing** and **code structure obfuscation**. These strategies ensure that while AI-driven testing continues to innovate, the risks associated with data exposure, permanence, and privacy are mitigated.
